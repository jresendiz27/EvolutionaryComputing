Boolean satisfiability problem (Evaluation)
=====================

Practice #2:

**Languages**

* Python 2.7.7 Anaconda.

According to the preview practice now we have to evaluate all the posibilities from 2^n, when n starts in 1 and ends in 20.

First all the maxiterms has to be generated; then evaluated an measure program performace by execution time.

The graphic will be generated using pyplot or matplotlib.

----------

* Step 1:
 
 The "huge" matrix will be generated using threads, according to the truth table for 20 variables.
 
* Step 2:
 
 Start getting just slices of the huge matrix in order to avoid generating all the values again and again.
 Getting all the maxiterms and saving just 1 inside the huge array.
 
* Step 3:

 All the performance values generated after the evaluation are going to be saved in script's scope; then generate the graphic and voil√†!
